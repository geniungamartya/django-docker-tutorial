## How to Define Model

The three-step guide to making model changes:

1. Change your models (in models.py).
2. Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
3. Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.

> A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing. Django follows the DRY Principle. The goal is to define your data model in one place and automatically derive things from it.
